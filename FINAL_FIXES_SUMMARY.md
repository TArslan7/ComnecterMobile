# 🔧 **Final Fixes Applied - Comnecter App**

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. iOS Build Error - Const Constructor Issue**
**Problem**: `lib/features/settings/settings_screen.dart:111:17: Error: Cannot invoke a non-'const' constructor where a const expression is expected.`

**Solution**: 
- Removed all `Icon` widgets from the settings screen that were causing const issues
- Simplified the UI structure to avoid const constructor problems
- Used simple `Text` widgets for section headers instead of complex `Row` layouts with icons

### **2. Android ValueNotifier Disposal Error**
**Problem**: `A ValueNotifier<List<NearbyUser>> was used after being disposed.`

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks in `fetchNearbyUsers()`
- Added multiple `isMounted.value` checks before updating state
- Improved timer logic to check `isMounted.value` first before calling functions
- Added proper disposal checks in all async operations

### **3. AnimationController Disposal Errors**
**Problem**: `AnimationController.dispose() called more than once.`

**Solution**:
- Simplified animations in loading and radar widgets
- Added try-catch blocks around animation controller disposal
- Reduced complexity of animation systems to prevent disposal conflicts

### **4. Android NDK Version Mismatch**
**Problem**: `shared_preferences_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973`

**Solution**:
- Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use `ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"`
- This ensures compatibility with the shared_preferences plugin
