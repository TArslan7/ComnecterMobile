## 🚀 **TEST THESE 3 FEEDS NOW (30 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Add Test Buttons (5 minutes)**

Add this to your Settings screen or any visible location:

```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';

// Add this widget to your screen:
Column(
  children: [
    Text('🧪 Test Discovery Feeds', 
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
    SizedBox(height: 16),
    
    ElevatedButton.icon(
      onPressed: () => context.push('/discover/all'),
      icon: Icon(Icons.explore),
      label: Text('Test All Feed'),
      style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
        minimumSize: Size(double.infinity, 50),
      ),
    ),
    SizedBox(height: 8),
    
    ElevatedButton.icon(
      onPressed: () => context.push('/discover/users'),
      icon: Icon(Icons.people),
      label: Text('Test Users Feed'),
      style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
        minimumSize: Size(double.infinity, 50),
      ),
    ),
    SizedBox(height: 8),
    
    ElevatedButton.icon(
      onPressed: () => context.push('/discover/communities'),
      icon: Icon(Icons.groups),
      label: Text('Test Communities Feed'),
      style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
        minimumSize: Size(double.infinity, 50),
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

### **Step 2: Run the App**

```bash
flutter run
```

### **Step 3: Quick Smoke Test (10 minutes)**

#### **Test 1: All Feed**
1. Tap "Test All Feed" button
2. ✅ Check: Loads with shimmer?
3. ✅ Check: Shows mix of users/communities/events?
4. ✅ Check: Can scroll vertically (TikTok-style)?
5. ✅ Check: Some cards have "BOOSTED" badge?
6. ✅ Check: Pull-to-refresh works?
7. ✅ Check: Tap "Connect" button works?
8. ✅ Check: Premium toggle shows paywall?

**Expected: All ✅**

#### **Test 2: Users Feed**
1. Tap "Test Users Feed" button
2. ✅ Check: Loads correctly?
3. ✅ Check: Shows ONLY users (no communities/events)?
4. ✅ Check: Scrolls smoothly?
5. ✅ Check: Boosted users appear first?
6. ✅ Check: Connect button works?

**Expected: All ✅**

#### **Test 3: Communities Feed** (NEW!)
1. Tap "Test Communities Feed" button
2. ✅ Check: Loads correctly?
3. ✅ Check: Shows ONLY communities (no users/events)?
4. ✅ Check: Community cards display:
   - Avatar/emoji?
   - Community name?
   - Description?

---

### **Step 4: Performance Check (5 minutes)**

For each feed:
1. Scroll through 20+ cards
2. ✅ Check: Smooth (no lag)?
3. ✅ Check: No crashes?
4. ✅ Check: Memory usage stable?

---

### **Step 5: Edge Cases (5 minutes)**

#### **Empty State:**
Currently won't show because mock data always returns items. Will test in production.

#### **Error Handling:**
Currently won't show because mock repo doesn't throw errors. Will test in production.

#### **Premium Features:**
- Tap "Hide Boosted" toggle
- ✅ Check: Shows paywall modal?
- ✅ Check: "Upgrade to Premium" button?
- ✅ Check: Navigates to subscription screen?

```

---

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations (Expected)**

These are intentional and expected:
1. **Mock Data** - All feeds use fake data
2. **Navigation Placeholders** - Tapping cards shows placeholder messages
3. **No Real API** - Everything is simulated
4. **No Events Feed Yet** - Still needs final screen file

---

## 🐛 **What to Report**

### **Report These as Bugs:**
- App crashes
- Feeds don't load
- Scrolling is janky
- Buttons don't work
- Premium toggle crashes
- Layout issues
- Text overflow
- Missing data

### **Don't Report These:**
- Mock/fake data (expected)
- "Navigation not implemented" messages (expected)
- Deprecation warnings in console (harmless)
- Events feed not working (not finished yet)

---

## 📈 **Success Criteria**

All feeds are ready when:
- ✅ No crashes
- ✅ Smooth scrolling (60fps)
- ✅ All buttons work
- ✅ Cards display correctly
- ✅ Premium toggle works
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh works
- ✅ Pagination loads more items

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Testing**

### If Tests Pass:
1. ✅ Complete Events feed screen
2. ✅ Add Events route
3. ✅ Test Events feed
4. ✅ Replace mock data with real API
5. ✅ Deploy to production!

### If Tests Fail:
1. Document bugs
2. Create GitHub issues
3. Fix critical bugs first
4. Re-test
5. Then proceed to Events feed

---

## 💡 **Quick Fixes for Common Issues**

### **Issue: "Can't find route"**
**Fix:** Make sure you added the test buttons with proper imports:
```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
```

### **Issue: "Feed doesn't load"**
**Fix:** Check console for errors. Likely Firebase not initialized (this is OK for now).

### **Issue: "Cards look broken"**
**Fix:** Probably a theme issue. Cards should still be functional.

### **Issue: "App crashes on start"**
**Fix:** Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get` then try again.
