# 🚀 Comnecter Development Workflow

## 📋 **Branching Strategy**

### **Main Branches:**
- **`master`** - Production-ready code (stable releases only)
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features (ongoing development)
- **`testing`** - Pre-release testing and validation

### **Feature Branches:**
- **`feature/feature-name`** - Individual features
- **`bugfix/bug-description`** - Bug fixes
- **`hotfix/urgent-fix`** - Critical production fixes

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **1. Starting New Development**
```bash
# Always start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
```

### **2. Development Process**
```bash
# Make your changes
# Test locally
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d "iPhone van Tolga"  # Test iOS
flutter run -d "Pixel 9"           # Test Android

# Commit with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
```

### **3. Pre-Merge Testing**
```bash
# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-feature-name

# Create Pull Request to testing branch
# Test thoroughly on testing branch
git checkout testing
git merge feature/new-feature-name
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d "iPhone van Tolga"
flutter run -d "Pixel 9"
```

### **4. Integration to Develop**
```bash
# Only after testing passes
git checkout develop
git merge testing
git push origin develop
```

### **5. Release to Master**
```bash
# Only stable, tested code
git checkout master
git merge develop
git tag v1.0.0  # Version tagging
git push origin master --tags
```

## 🛡️ **Error Prevention Checklist**

### **Before Committing:**
- [ ] `flutter analyze` - No errors
- [ ] `flutter test` - All tests pass
- [ ] Code compiles on both platforms
- [ ] No console errors during runtime
- [ ] UI/UX works as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### **Before Merging to Testing:**
- [ ] Feature is complete
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes

### **Before Merging to Develop:**
- [ ] Testing branch validation passed
- [ ] Cross-platform testing completed
- [ ] Performance testing done
- [ ] Security review completed

### **Before Merging to Master:**
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Production deployment tested
- [ ] Release notes prepared
- [ ] Version tagged

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Automated Testing:**
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### **Manual Testing:**
```bash
# iOS Testing
flutter run -d "iPhone van Tolga"

# Android Testing
flutter run -d "Pixel 9"

# Web Testing
flutter run -d chrome
```

### **Performance Testing:**
```bash
# Profile mode
flutter run --profile -d "iPhone van Tolga"

# Performance analysis
flutter run --trace-startup -d "iPhone van Tolga"
```

## 🔧 **Code Quality Tools**

### **Static Analysis:**
```bash
# Run analyzer
flutter analyze

# Fix auto-fixable issues
dart fix --apply
```

### **Code Formatting:**
```bash
# Format code
dart format .

# Check formatting
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
```

### **Dependency Management:**
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
flutter pub outdated

# Update dependencies safely
flutter pub upgrade
```

## 📝 **Commit Message Convention**

### **Format:**
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### **Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

### **Examples:**
```
feat(radar): add user detection animations
fix(auth): resolve login validation issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### **Hotfix Process:**
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from master
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix

# Make minimal fix
# Test thoroughly
# Merge directly to master and develop
```

### **Rollback Process:**
```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD

# Rollback to specific commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

## 📊 **Quality Gates**

### **Must Pass Before Merge:**
1. **Static Analysis** - `flutter analyze` (0 errors)
2. **Unit Tests** - `flutter test` (100% pass)
3. **Integration Tests** - Manual testing on both platforms
4. **Performance** - No significant performance regression
5. **Security** - No security vulnerabilities

### **Recommended:**
1. **Code Coverage** - >80% coverage
2. **Documentation** - All public APIs documented
3. **Performance** - <3s app startup time
4. **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Development:**
- ✅ Write tests first (TDD)
- ✅ Keep commits small and focused
- ✅ Use descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Review code before merging
- ✅ Test on multiple devices
- ✅ Document complex logic

### **Avoid:**
- ❌ Committing directly to master
- ❌ Large, unfocused commits
- ❌ Skipping tests
- ❌ Ignoring analyzer warnings
- ❌ Merging without review
- ❌ Breaking existing functionality

## 📈 **Continuous Improvement**

### **Regular Reviews:**
- Weekly code quality review
- Monthly performance analysis
- Quarterly security audit
- Bi-annual dependency updates

### **Metrics to Track:**
- Build success rate
- Test coverage percentage
- Bug frequency
- Performance metrics
- User satisfaction scores

**Remember:** Quality over speed. It's better to take time to do it right than to rush and create technical debt.
